### Introduction

The code in this repository will let you train a Neural Network to play Pong solely based on the input frames of the game and the results of each round.

### Setup

1. Install Openai Gym [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs). 
2. Run `pip install -e '.[atari]'`.

### Seeing the game

### Performance

According to the blog post, this algorithm should take around 3 days of training on a Macbook to start beating the computer.

Consider tweaking the hyperparameters or using CNNs to boost the performance further.

### Misc.

Note, if you want to run Andrej Karpathy's original code, run `python pong.py`.
